Description: Developed as a collaboration between Earth lab and the North Central Climate Adaptation Science Center to help users gain insights from available climate data. Includes tools and instructions for downloading climate data via a 'USGS' API and then organizing those data for visualization and analysis that drive insight. Web interface for 'USGS' API can be found at <http://thredds.northwestknowledge.net:8080/thredds/reacch_climate_CMIP5_aggregated_macav2_catalog.html>.
